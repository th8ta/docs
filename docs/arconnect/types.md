title: Types

To support ArConnect types, you can install the npm package `arconnect`:

```sh
npm i -D arconnect
```

or

```sh
yarn add -D arconnect
```

To add the types to your project, you should either include the package in your `tsconfig.json`, or add the following to your `env.d.ts` file:

```ts
/// <reference types="arconnect" />
```

Type declarations can be found [here](https://github.com/th8ta/ArConnect/blob/development/types/index.d.ts).
